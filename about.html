            Whirred is a game - a whirred game. Or word game if you will. It's about testing yourself with a daily challenge to see if you can start with a base word and create several other words from it by following some basic rules. 

            It's not our 1st stab at these types of games as you will see some other word and logic games at <a href="www.playnerdle.com">playnerdle.com</a>.
            
            Making these games is a bit of a hobby but that's how wordle started and look at the success of that. What caught my imagination with that was how it managed to go viral through simplicity, iconic look and feel and the social share element. 

            The game code is all there in the browser. Nothing is hidden and you could quite easily make copies of the game with a little understanding of web technologies. 

            I'm all self taught with the help of Youtube and Stack Overflow and my day job involves web technologies. If you do have any further queries please feel free to <a href="./contact.html">contact us</a> and we/I will endeavour to respond as promptly as I can. 

            I hope you enjoy the game. All feedback welcome.

            Stuart
